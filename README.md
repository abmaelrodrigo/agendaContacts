This project consists on automating the process of inserting a new contact on the site https://agendap.com/ , using a dependency from Selenium called EasyTest, in order to test if this web page work well during the insertions. The steps are:

1 – Open the site https://agendap.com/ ;
2 – Click on login;
3 – Enter valid username and password;
4 – Click on ‘Register a new contact’ ;
5 – Insert a name;  
6 - Insert a phone;
7 - Insert an email;
8 – Click on ‘Create a new contact’.

The same project was also rewritten using the Page Objects technique (https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/PageObjects).
